Real world data is messy, large in quantity and interrelated.
Relationships - Different ways the data/tables can be related.

Common Types of Relationships:
1. One to One
2. One to Many or Many to One
3. Many to Many

One to One Relationships between tables are not that common. An example would be the relations b/w the Customers table and Details table that contains the detailed information about the
customers.

One to Many or Many to One is the usual type of relationship observed. Example -> Books and Reviews table. A book can have many reviews but a review can be associated with only one book for
which it was posted against.

Many to Many is a relatively common relationship. Ex-> Books and Authors - A book can have multiple authors and an author might have written multiple books.


One to Many Relationship:
Ex- Customers and Orders
What we want to store:
A customer's first and last name (Customers)
A customer's email (Customers)
The data of the purchase (Orders)
The price of the order (Orders)

FOREIGN KEY - Foreign key is a column in a table that references another column in a different table. The main purpose for this key is to act as a kind of a bridge between the two tables
and enforce some rules like it won't allow an entry in its table unless there is already an entry that exists in the other table.
