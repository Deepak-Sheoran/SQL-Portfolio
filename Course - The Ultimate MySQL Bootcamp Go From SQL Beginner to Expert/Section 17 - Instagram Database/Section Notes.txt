To create a database for an app like Instagram at the most basic level one will need to store the following information:
- Users
- Comments
- Photos
- Likes
- Follower/Followees
- Hashtags

Users:
The User table in the Instagram database will need at least the following columns
User Id - Primary key of the table to uniquely identify each row
User Name - Name of the user, we can apply the unique constraint so no two users have the same name

Photos:
The Photos table must have the following columns:
Photo_Id - Primary key to distinguish each photo entry from one another
User_Id - Points to the User that uploaded the photo
Image_URL
The relationship between Users and Photos table will be one to many, a user can upload multiple photos on their account after all.

Comments:
The comments table will have relationship with the above two table since its a user that comments and they are commenting on a photo/post written by another user
Comment_Id
Comment_Text
User_Id - User that posted that comment
Photo_Id - Photo related to which the comment was posted

Likes:
Same as the comments, here we will need:
User_Id - The user that liked the photo
Photo_Id - The photo that was liked by the user
we can put the constraint of Unique on User_Id, Photo_Id to make sure the same user cannot like the photo again and again

Follows:
This table keeps records of which user is following whom
Follower_Id - The one who is following another user
Followee_Id - The user to whom the follower is following

Tags:
To implement the concept of Tags that are applied to a photo we will have to use two table to store the tags and then another table that will works to create a relationship between 
the Photos and the Tags table
