Notes:
-> After setting up a database server the first step would be to accessing that server using a user profile through an interface like a simple shell or an IDLE like My SQL Workbench.
-> Once we have the access through a terminal we can use SQL syntax to write the commands to create, update or even delete the databases stored inside a server.


SQL Queries:

Database related queries:

-> SHOW DATABASES; --Presents names of all the databases that exists within the server

-> CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS <database_name>; --Creates a new database if a database with the name we are trying to create doesn't exists

-> USE <database_name>; --Selects a database for use/access/manipulation.

-> SELECT DATABASE(); --Shows what database we are currently using

-> DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS <database_name>; --Deletes a database from the server if it exists, doesn't throw an error if it doesn't exists.
