Server SQL Modes - They are basically settings that we can turn on and off to change the behaviour and validations of MySQL.
Modes affect the SQL syntax MySQL supports and the data validation checks it performs.

Viewing the current modes that are in effect:
1. SELECT @@GLOBAL.sql_mode;   - Shows the sql modes that are active in the global scale
2. SELECT @@SESSION.sql_mode;  - Shows the sql modes that are active in the current session, should be the same as the global unless we do some changes

Changing the modes:
We basically have to list all the modes in a piece of text in quotes
Syntax:
1. SET GLOBAL sql_mode = 'modes';
2. SET SESSION sql_mode = 'modes';

Changing the modes in a session is more practical since going with the other option leaves us with more permanent changes.
