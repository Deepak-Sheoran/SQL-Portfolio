Q. What is a Database?
-> A Database is a collection of data that is stored electronically. The data that a database can store can be words, numbers, images, videos and even files.
OR A Database is a collection of data and is equipped with a method for accessing and manipulating that data.
OR A structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface.

Q. What is a Database Management System?
-> A database management system works as an interface between the user and the database. Using a DBMS's interface we can write commands and then run those commands to get the output.

Note - Often times, the terms Database is used to represent the Database and Database Management System combined.
       Examples of Database Management Systems - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite.

Q. What is the difference between MySQL and SQL?
-> SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is the language we use to "talk" to a database i.e., we can write commands using the SQL in the interface provided by the DBMS to manipulate
   the data stored inside a database.

   A quick perview:
   Find all users that are 18 years and older.
       SELECT *
       FROM Users
       WHERE Age >= 18;

Working with MySQL (DBMS) is primarily writing SQL (programming language).

Main Takeaways:
1. Once we have learned the SQL language, its pretty easy to switch between different DBMS that use SQL.
2. What makes DBMS unique are the features they offer, not the language with which they operate since almost all the popular ones use SQL.
