Logical Operators - Logical operators allow us to check for more advanced conditions by letting us check for multiple conditions at the same time.
Following are some of the logical operators built-in MySQL using which we can write more complex query.

Conditional Operators:
1. Not Equal -> != or <>
2. NOT LIKE
3. Greater Than -> >
4. Less Than -> <

6. Less Than Equal to -> <=
7. 
8.
