Logical Operators - Logical operators allow us to check for more advanced conditions by letting us check for multiple conditions at the same time.
Following are some of the logical operators built-in MySQL using which we can write more complex query.

1. Not Equal -> != or <>
2. NOT LIKE
3. Greater Than -> > and >=
4. Less Than -> < and <=
5. Logical AND
6. Logical OR

Note - Logical AND and Logical OR can be used to check for multiple conditions.
