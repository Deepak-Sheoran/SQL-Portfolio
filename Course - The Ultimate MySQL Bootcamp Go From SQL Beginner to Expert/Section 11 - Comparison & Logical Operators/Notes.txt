Logical Operators - Logical operators allow us to check for more advanced conditions by letting us check for multiple conditions at the same time.
Following are some of the logical operators built-in MySQL using which we can write more complex query.

Conditional Operators:
1. Not Equal -> != or <>
2. NOT LIKE
3. Greater Than -> >
4. Less Than -> <
5. Greater Than Equal To -> >=
6. Less Than Equal to -> <=
7. 
8. 

Logical Operators:
1. Logical AND -> All conditions must be true for the operator to return true
2. Logical OR -> Only one condition has to be true for the operator to return true

Note - Logical AND and Logical OR can be used to check for multiple conditions.
