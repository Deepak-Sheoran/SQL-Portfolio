Window Functions:
   A window function performs a calculation across a set of rows that are related to the current row, without collapsing the rows into a single output (unlike GROUP BY).
   It creates a “window” of rows defined by OVER() and computes values like rankings, running totals, moving averages, or comparisons with previous/next rows.
Or in simple terms - Window function perform aggregate operations on groups of rows, but they produce a result FOR EACH ROW.

Non Aggregate Window Functions: (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/window-function-descriptions.html)
    Nonaggregate window functions that, for each row from a query, perform a calculation using rows related to that row.

CUME_DIST()	Cumulative distribution value
DENSE_RANK()	Rank of current row within its partition, without gaps
FIRST_VALUE()	Value of argument from first row of window frame
LAG()	        Value of argument from row lagging current row within partition
LAST_VALUE()	Value of argument from last row of window frame
LEAD()	        Value of argument from row leading current row within partition
NTH_VALUE()	Value of argument from N-th row of window frame
NTILE()	        Bucket number of current row within its partition.
PERCENT_RANK()	Percentage rank value
RANK()	        Rank of current row within its partition, with gaps
ROW_NUMBER()	Number of current row within its partition
